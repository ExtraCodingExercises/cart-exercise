# Shopping Cart Exercise

The goal of this exercise is to practice DOM manipulation with JavaScript, study HTML tables, and practice designing an algorithm with PseudoCode.

## Steps

1. Open the starter_code folder
2. Edit the `js/app.js` file
3. Use the comments to guide each step

The goal is to build the cart so that it looks like the `samplePopulated.html` file but has dynamic data in it. The data is already provided in javascript.
